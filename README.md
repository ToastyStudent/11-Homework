# 11-Homework-Notetaker-Challenge

## Description
This project was built from code provided via Northwestern University's Full-stack Development Coding Bootcamp's TAs, with me rewriting code in order to ensure I understand how to properly build the app were I to attempt to do so again under less time constraints than those I am currently under.

Specifically, I used an Express.js back end with a pre-established front end to create, save, retrieve, AND delete note data from a JSON file.

# Installation and Usage
No installation is required. One only needs to visit the deployed Heroku page for this project in order to interact/use it properly. 

Said interaction/usage would involve simply creating and deleting titled notes which will remain on the page, being stored in local storage.
